# CorpSim Roadmap

## Now (Live and Working)

* Deterministic simulation core (economy, market, production, contracts, research, logistics)
* Player/company ownership enforcement and Better Auth (email/password, Google, 2FA)
* Onboarding flow with required first-time tutorial
* Maintenance mode with simulation pause behavior
* Toast/control/shortcut systems and in-app profile panel
* Schema-readiness gate before game boot

## Next (Priority Work)

* Economy depth: storage limits/costs, scarcity, spoilage, demand tuning
* Business systems: workforce depth, pricing automation, marketing, loans/credit
* Multiplayer hardening: anti-cheat/exploit detection, stricter concurrency/load validation, and operator runbooks
* Security hardening: auth abuse protection tuning, recovery/verification flows, and sensitive-action auditing
* UX polish: stronger dashboard workflows, automation tools, accessibility passes
* Infra reliability: observability, replay/snapshot tooling, safer reset/backup flows

## Later (Expansion)

* Multiplayer economy features (player contracts, transfers/mergers, alliances, leaderboards)
* Advanced world simulation (tariffs, disruptions, infrastructure effects)
* Deeper market/finance analytics and forecasting tools
* Smarter long-horizon bot behavior
* Large content expansions across new sectors and industries
* Long-term platform goals (mobile UX quality, API/modding ecosystem, release strategy)
