summary: Replace numbered generated item display names with descriptive names and curated produce naming.
---

- Replace generated display names such as `Medical Compound 02` with descriptive, category-aware names.
- Add curated Agri Produce names so early entries map to concrete crops (for example index 01 is `Potato`).
- Keep item codes stable while improving seeded item and recipe naming readability in UI and API payloads.
