summary: Add editable keyboard shortcuts with saved local bindings
---

- Add shortcut rebinding in the shortcuts help overlay (`Ctrl + /`) with Edit and Reset actions.
- Persist player shortcut bindings in versioned local storage so custom keys survive reloads and restarts.
- Suspend shortcut execution while capturing a new key combo to avoid accidental in-game actions.
